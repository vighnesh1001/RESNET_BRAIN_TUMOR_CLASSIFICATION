Implementation of [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385) using PyTorch.This project includes the code for training and deployment on HuggingFace spaces using gradio.

## DATASET 
The data set used for training and testing is the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) from Kaggle.


## RESNET
ResNet was proposed in  2015 by researchers at Microsoft Research . The specialty of the model is its skip connection  or the residual blocks with which deep Neural Networks can be made without the problem of vanishing gradiant.The skip connection connects activations from one layer to later layers by skipping some layers in between.
