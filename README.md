Implementation of [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385) using pytorch.This project include the code for training and the deployment on HuggingFace spaces using gradio.

## DATA SET 
The data set used for training and testing is the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) from Kaggle.


## RESNET
ResNet was proposed at the year 2015 by researchers at Microsoft Research . The speciality of the model is its skip connection  or the residual blocks with which deep Neural Networks can be made without the problem of vanishing gradiant.The skip connection connects activations of a  layer to further layers by skipping some layers in between.
